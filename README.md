# Hello, Username!
This repo contains Vagrant File which helps you quickly deploy OWASP Juice-Shop and Kali Linux at your PC.
If you are a Windows User - you have to use Putty to get connected to Juice-shop VM with ssh-key. But the Private key created by default by VAgrant is in Old PEM format and you have to convert it with PuttyGen tool.
Just open the deafult private key  ( which, by the word,can be located by `vagrant ssh-config` command) by PuttyGen and save the new Private key as different Private Key File at the same folder.
